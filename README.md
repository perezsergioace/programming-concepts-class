# Programming Concepts

## Course Description:

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to analyze a problem and design
a complete computer program using functions, loops, conditional statements, and input and
output statements. This will be accomplished using a combination of tools, including flowcharts,
pseudocode, and Python.

# Course Objectives

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Use programming terminology correctly in discussion of course topics
* Identify the need for a variable and select the appropriate primitive data representation
* Distinguish between a reference to an array and a reference to an array element
* Write simple mathematical formulae in pseudocode and flowcharts
* Write Boolean expressions to control the flow of a program
* Write programs that use internal documentation and standard white space conventions to communicate program design
* Create flowcharts and write syntactically correct pseudocode to solve small programming problems using structured programming techniques
* Use a variety of desk-checking or debugging techniques on programs written with structured programming techniques
