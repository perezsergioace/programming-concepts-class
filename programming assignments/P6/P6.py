# 1.) Write an if/else program that determines if a person is old enough to drink.
# (legal age we will assume 21) 

# 2.) Write an if/else/elif program that asks a user for their favorite color.
# Put a statement in that if the person chooses yellow the program will return “Yellow is also my favorite color” 
# and if the person puts red it will say “Red is the color of my favorite roses.” 
# For all other colors the response should be “That is an interesting color choice.”
# Test the program with yellow, red and two other colors.  

# 3.) Write a program that asks a user for 2 numbers. 
# If the numbers total more than 100 tell them their numbers are greater than 100, 
# if they total less than 100 tell them their numbers total less than 100.  

# 4.) Draw a flowchart for the each of the decision structures in Questions 1, 2, 3
# *you can include a snapshot or use a program to draw the flowcharts

# 5.) In the book page 155. Wi-Fi Diagnostic Tree. 
# This is an if/else program. NOTHING ELSE. 
# Follow the diagram (page 156) and write the decision structure. 
# You are not declaring variables, you are only writing the Decision Structure of the program.
# You should NOT have any “answers” in your program.
# You should only have : 
# o	If statements
# o	Else statements
# o	Print statements
# o	Response statements
