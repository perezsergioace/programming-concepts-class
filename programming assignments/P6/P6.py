# 1.) Write an if/else program that determines if a person is old enough to drink.
# (legal age we will assume 21) 

# creating variables
age = 0.0

# creating constant named variables
legal_age = 21

# prompting the user to enter their age
age = int(input('Enter current age: '))

# creatig if else statement to determine if the user's age is at the legal age to drink
# if the age is less than 21 the program will print out a message letting the user know they are not at the legal age to drink
if age < 21:
    print('You are not at the legal age to drink.')
# this else statement will print out a message letting the user know they are at the legal age since the initial if statement did not pass 
else:
    print('You are old enough to drink.')

# 2.) Write an if/else/elif program that asks a user for their favorite color.
# Put a statement in that if the person chooses yellow the program will return “Yellow is also my favorite color” 
# and if the person puts red it will say “Red is the color of my favorite roses.” 
# For all other colors the response should be “That is an interesting color choice.”
# Test the program with yellow, red and two other colors.  


# 3.) Write a program that asks a user for 2 numbers. 
# If the numbers total more than 100 tell them their numbers are greater than 100, 
# if they total less than 100 tell them their numbers total less than 100.  

# 4.) Draw a flowchart for the each of the decision structures in Questions 1, 2, 3
# *you can include a snapshot or use a program to draw the flowcharts

# 5.) In the book page 155. Wi-Fi Diagnostic Tree. 
# This is an if/else program. NOTHING ELSE. 
# Follow the diagram (page 156) and write the decision structure. 
# You are not declaring variables, you are only writing the Decision Structure of the program.
# You should NOT have any “answers” in your program.
# You should only have : 
# o	If statements
# o	Else statements
# o	Print statements
# o	Response statements
