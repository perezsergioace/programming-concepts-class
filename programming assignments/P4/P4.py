# Use this formula for the distance that a car travels down the interstate:  
# 	Distance  = Speed * Time 
# The car is traveling 82 miles per hour.  Write a program that displays the following: 
# 1.	The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
# 2.	The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
# 3.	The distance the car will travel in 15 hours.  

# Initiating variables
car_speed = 82
six_hours = 6
ten_hours = 10
fifteen_hours = 15

# Initiating distance variables for each hours
six_hour_distance = 0.0
ten_hour_distance = 0.0
fifteen_hour_distance = 0.0

# Calculating the distance for 6 hours

# Calculating the distance for 10 hours

# Calculating the distance for 15 hours
